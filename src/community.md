## Join the PyTorch-Ignite Community

To thrive, the PyTorch-Ignite project needs your expertise and enthusiasm. Not a coder? Not a problem! There are many ways to contribute to PyTorch-Ignite.

Please checkout [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/pytorch/ignite/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## About us

### History

This project was started by Alykhan Tejani [@alykhantejani](https://github.com/alykhantejani),
Francisco Massa [@fmassa](https://github.com/fmassa) and Joost van Amersfoort [@y0ast](https://github.com/y0ast)
in the end of 2017 and was highly inspired by [torchnet](https://github.com/pytorch/tnt).

In 2018, the project core team had grown and the first public release was published in June 2018.
Since then, several releases have appeared following a ~5 month cycle, with a thriving international community leading the development.

### Governance

PyTorch-Ignite is a [NumFOCUS Affiliated Project](https://numfocus.org/sponsored-projects/affiliated-projects) and 
open-source community effort. 
The Project's affiliation to [PyTorch organization](https://github.com/pytorch) is due in large part to historical reasons and it 
has the same implication to the project's governance as the other community projects from the
[PyTorch Ecosystem](https://pytorch.org/ecosystem/).

The decision making process and governance structure of the project is described in the [governance document](https://pytorch.org/ignite/master/governance.html).

### Authors

The following people are currently core contributors to PyTorch-Ignite’s development and maintenance:

- Victor Fomin [@vfdev-5](https://github.com/vfdev-5)
- Sylvain Desroziers [@sdesrozis](https://github.com/sdesrozis)
- Taras Savchyn [@trsvchn](https://github.com/trsvchn)

### Emeritus Core Developers

The following people have been active contributors in the past, but are no longer active in the project:

- Alykhan Tejani [@alykhantejani](https://github.com/alykhantejani)
- Jason Kriss [@jasonkriss](https://github.com/jasonkriss)
- Anmol Joshi [@anmolsjoshi](https://github.com/anmolsjoshi)

### Join Core Team

We are looking for motivated contributors to become collaborators and help out with the project.
We can start considering a candidate after several successfully merged GitHub pull requests.
If you are interested, for more details, please, contact Victor (vfdev-5#4458) on [PyTorch-Ignite Discord](https://discord.gg/djZtm3EmKj).

### Citing PyTorch-Ignite

If you use PyTorch-Ignite in a scientific publication, we would appreciate citations to the project.

```
@misc{pytorch-ignite,
  author = {V. Fomin and J. Anmol and S. Desroziers and J. Kriss and A. Tejani},
  title = {High-level library to help with training neural networks in PyTorch},
  year = {2020},
  publisher = {GitHub},
  journal = {GitHub repository},
  howpublished = {\url{https://github.com/pytorch/ignite}},
}
```

### Acknowledgements

We gratefully acknowledge the contributions of [all open-source developers](https://github.com/pytorch/ignite/graphs/contributors)
who helped get this project off of the ground and supported the project.

We especially appreciate amazing work of Isabela Presedo-Floyd [@isabela-pf](https://github.com/isabela-pf)  on project's logo,
its [elaboration](https://github.com/pytorch/ignite/issues/1221) and [guidelines](https://github.com/pytorch/ignite/blob/master/assets/logo/ignite_logo_guidelines.md).
Our new logos can be found [here](https://github.com/pytorch/ignite/tree/master/assets/logo).

We are also grateful to Soumith Chintala [@soumith](https://github.com/soumith), Joe Spisak [@jspisak](https://github.com/jspisak)
from Facebook for their help and to [PyTorch group](https://github.com/pytorch) for infrastructure support
(GPU CI and hosting of conda releases and our documentation).

In particular, Victor Fomin [@vfdev-5](https://github.com/vfdev-5) acknowledges [Magellium](https://www.magellium.com/)
and [Quansight](https://www.quansight.com/) for supporting project's development. Sylvain Desroziers [@sdesrozis](https://github.com/sdesrozis)
also gratefully acknowledges the support of [IFPEN](https://www.ifpenergiesnouvelles.fr/).

We also acknowledge [scikit-learn project](https://scikit-learn.org)'s documentation on governance, author's presentation etc
from which this project is highly inspired.
