# Ecosystem

If your project implements a paper, represents other use-cases not covered in our official tutorials, Kaggle competition's code, or just your code presents interesting results and uses PyTorch-Ignite. We would like to add your project to this list, so please open an issue here: https://github.com/pytorch-ignite/pytorch-ignite.ai/issues with brief description of the project.

The list below is unexhausted list of references that we are aware of.
